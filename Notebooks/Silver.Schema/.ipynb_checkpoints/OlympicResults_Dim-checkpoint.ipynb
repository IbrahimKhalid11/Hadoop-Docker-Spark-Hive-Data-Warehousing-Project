Reza Zadeh led after the snatch with 210.0 kg, and then lifted a world record 262.5 kg in the clean & jerk, matching his world record total of 472.5 kg. His clean & jerk was re-measured at 263.5 kg for record purposes. German Ronny Weller had been the silver medalist in this class in 1996 and 2000, and had won medals at the last four Olympics. Attempting to become the first weightlifter to win five medals, he injured himself on his second snatch, and dropped out of the competition. Latvia’s Viktors Ščerbatihs won silver, although well behind Reza Zadeh, and he would return in 2008 and add a bronze medal in the class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |False      |Super-Heavyweight, Men                 |\n",

The heavy favorite was France’s Karine Ruby, who had won all but one World Cup event in 1997-98, and had won the 1996 FIS World Championships. On the first run, she overwhelmed the field, leading by 1.95 second over her teammate, Isabelle Blanc. On the second run Ruby boarded carefully to protect her lead but still won the gold medal by almost two seconds over Germany’s Heidi Renoth. Blanc had the silver medal in her grasp when she missed the final gate on her second run, and fell, sliding across the finish line. Ruby would compete again at the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal in 2002 in parallel giant slalom, and switching to boardercross for the 2006 Winter Olympics. She then began training to become a mountain guide and was killed in late May 2009 when she fell into a crevasse on Mont Blanc. Isabelle Blanc returned in 2002 to win the gold medal in the parallel giant slalom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |False      |Giant Slalom, Women                    |\n",

The strength of the East German team was shown from the fact that the reigning World Champion and 1972 bronze medallist, Wolfram Fiedler, did not make the cut. This left 1973 World Champion Hans Rinn as the clear favourite. But he made a serious error in the first run, putting him 0.6 seconds behind Dettlef Günther, who had been the 1975 European Champion, but had only managed a 7th spot at the World Championships. Günther would also win the 3rd and 4th run, giving him a comfortable lead. Only West German Josef Fendt could seriously challenge him, but even the former World Champion (1970, 1973) had to concede half a second in the final standings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |False      |Singles, Men                           |\n",

On the year list in 1936, he was just ahead of German Hans Woellke. But in Berlin Torrance performed poorly and would finish only fifth. Woellke led after round one with 15.96 (52-4½) in the final, but Finland’s Sulo Bärlund moved ahead with 16.03 (52-7¼) in the second round. They both improved in round five, with Woellke winning gold with 16.20 (53-1¾), and Bärlund’s 16.12 (52-10¾) good for silver.

The women raced 800 metres on the track with eight competitors. Australian Louise Sauvage had won this event in 1996 and 2000, but in Athina, the victory went to Canadian Chantal Petitclerc, with Sauvage placing third behind her teammate Eliza Stankovich. Petitclerc, who lost the use of both legs at age 13 when a barn door fell on her, had one of the most storied Paralympic careers, winning 21 medals, with 13 golds, between 1992-2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |False      |800 metres Wheelchair, Women           |\n",

She had come back to win the 2009 World Championships in the event, had also won the distance World Cup in 2008-09, and was leading that competition coming into Vancouver, narrowly ahead of Bjørgen. At 20 km there will still a number of skiers in contention, but after ski changes Kowalczyk and Bjørgen began to pull away from the field, until only these two were in contention for the gold and silver. Bjørgen made the first move, pulling ahead of Kowalczyk with a few kilometres to go and gaining around a 6-second advantage, but the lead was never decisive and Kowalczyk caught up with her on the final climb. It then came down to a sprint to the line which Kowalczyk won, covering the course in a time of 1-30:33.7, just 0.3 seconds ahead of Bjørgen. The bronze medal was won by Aino-Kaisa Saarinen (FIN), her finishing time being over a minute behind the other medallists, but comfortably ahead of fourth placed Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle (GER). After the race, Kowalczyk apologized to Bjørgen for her accusations, “I am sorry, because it wasn’t such a good time for such a question and opinion. It wasn’t an attack on Marit. She is a very good athlete, but I was trying to talk about the asthma problem we have in cross-country, there are a lot of athletes sick with asthma.” Bjørgen also addressed the issue after the race, “That annoyed me a little bit, but for me it’s already yesterday’s news. I was a little bit disappointed in the beginning when she started this, but I have to forget it.”|False      |30 kilometres, Women                   |\n",

Only canoeists from Canada and the United States competed in 1924, so it was hardly an international competition. There were three competitors in this event, which was won by American Bud Havens, ahead of Canada’s Roy Nurse. Havens’ nephews, Frank and William Havens, competed in canoeing for the United States at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |False      |Kayak Singles, 800 metres, Men         |\n",

But he turned professional in 1975 and was not in Montréal. A bronze medalist from the 1974 Worlds was there, however, one Leon Spinks of the United States. An ungainly fighter with powerful hands, but seemingly little skill, Spinks made it to the final and entered the ring shortly after his brother, Michael, had won a gold medal in the middleweight final. In the final Leon met Cuba’s Sixto Soria, who had not fought the distance in any bout in Montréal, winning his quarter-final and semi-final in the first rounds. But the final was no contest, as Spinks battered Soria all around the ring for three rounds, with the referee mercifully stopping the bout at 1:09 of the third. Soria would come back in 1978 to win the World Championship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |False      |Light-Heavyweight, Men                 |\n",

He had won the 1959 World Championships, was Olympic lightweight gold medalist in 1956, and the 1958 Asian Champion. He was thought to be the “unbeatable Iranian.” Nobody outside of the United States had heard of American Doug Blubaugh but Habibi would soon find out. Blubaugh won his first four matches, three by falls, and one by walkover, and then met Habibi in round five, throwing him in 2:37 to eliminate Habibi, who would finish in a tie for fourth.

She had finished second at the 1991 World Championships behind Xu Demei (CHN), while the 1990 European Champion was Finland’s Päivi Alafrantti. But the best throwers in 1992 had been Belarussian Nataliya Shikolenko and Norway’s Trine Hattestad, and they led the qualifiers. Shikolenko took the lead in the final with 68.26 (223-11½) in the first round. Round one produced all the medalists as Silke Renk (GER) threw 67.24 (220-7¼) and Karen Forkel, eventual bronze medalist, threw 65.02 (213-4), and nobody would surpass those marks except the leaders.

The event was held separately from the all-around. This was a specialist’s event as many of the competitors, notably the entire Italian and USA contingents, did not compete in the all-around. The gold medal went to American George Gulack, who was a Latvian emigré, followed by his teammate Tom Denton, with Italy’s Giovanni Lattuada winning bronze. Gulack was the US National Champion on the rings in 1928 and 1935, with Denton winning that title in 1932, but little else is known of Lattuada’s career.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |False      |Rings, Men                             |\n",

Defending champion West German Frank Wieneke was back but had not won a major title since 1984. The Japanese World Champion Hirotaka Okada was expected to challenge for a medal. Also highly considered was Britain’s five-time European Champion Neil Adams, twice an Olympic silver medalist. Adams had come out of retirement to chase the one medal that had escaped him during his career. But the division was marked by upset after upset. Adams went out to East German, Torsten Bréchôt, who had been 1985 World runner-up when known as Torsten Oehmigen. Okada was defeated by Frenchman Pascal Tayot, a strong, muscular fighter with little technique. One pool final matched Wieneke against Bréchôt, with Wieneke closing it out with a koka with seven seconds remaining. The other pool final matched Russian Bashir Varayev, 1987 World runner-up, against Poland’s Waldemar Legień, the 1985 European silver medalist. Legień won by decision, but Varayev’s actions made everyone in the crowd know he did not agree with the result. Just after four minutes into the final, Legień dropped to his back to begin groundwork. Wieneke attacked, but Legień grabbed him and threw with seoi-nage for ippon to win the gold medal at 4:44. Legień would return in 1992 to win gold in the middleweight class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |False      |Half-Middleweight, Men                 |\n",
